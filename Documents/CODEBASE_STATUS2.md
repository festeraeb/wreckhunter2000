# CESAROps Codebase Status Report

_Last updated: March 21, 2026_

## Overview
CESAROps (Civilian Emergency Search and Rescue Operations Platform) is a comprehensive SAR tool for the Great Lakes, focused on drift prediction, environmental data integration, analytics, and reporting. This report summarizes the current state of the codebase, what is working, what is incomplete or stubbed, and the intended purpose of each module.

---

## Module Status Summary

### 1. Core Engine (`src/cesarops/core/`)
- **drift_engine.py**: **Fully implemented.** Main OpenDrift-based simulation engine for Great Lakes drift modeling. Handles model setup, configuration, and data readers.
- **physics.py**: **Fully implemented.** Provides geospatial and wind/current vector math utilities.
- **enhanced_drift.py**: **Mostly implemented,** but ML post-correction is a **placeholder** (not full per-timestep correction).

### 2. Data Acquisition (`src/cesarops/data/`)
- **drifter_collector.py**: **Fully implemented.** Collects and stores real drifter data from multiple sources (GDP, GLOS, etc.).
- **glerl.py, ndbc.py, nws.py, coops.py, usgs.py**: **Fully implemented.** Fetch and cache environmental data from respective sources.
- **sentinel.py**: **Partially implemented.** Some methods end with `pass` (incomplete).

### 3. Database & Config (`src/cesarops/database.py`, `src/cesarops/config.py`)
- **database.py**: **Fully implemented.** SQLite DB schema, context manager, and all major data storage/retrieval functions.
- **config.py**: **Fully implemented.** Loads YAML config, merges with defaults, and provides helpers for lake bounding boxes and ERDDAP URLs.

### 4. Analytics & ML (`src/cesarops/analytics/`, `src/cesarops/ml/`)
- **drift_analyzer.py**: **Fully implemented** for trajectory comparison and POA, but some methods (e.g., environmental data query) are **placeholders** (return synthetic data).
- **case_study.py**: Not fully scanned, but referenced in CLI for case analysis.
- **ml/predictor.py**: **Mostly implemented.** Model loading and prediction logic present, but some methods use `pass` (incomplete).
- **ml/trainer.py**: Not fully scanned, but referenced in CLI for training.

### 5. Cloud Sync (`src/cesarops/cloud/`)
- **oracle_db.py**: **Fully implemented.** Oracle Cloud DB backend for data sync and caching.
- **data_sync.py**: **Fully implemented.** Orchestrates fetching from public APIs and storing in Oracle cache.

### 6. Reports & Export (`src/cesarops/reports/`)
- **kml_export.py**: **Fully implemented.** KML export for drift results.
- **literature.py, incident_report.py**: Not fully scanned, but referenced in CLI for literature search and reporting.

### 7. Sonar Overlay (`src/cesarops/sonar/`)
- **overlay.py**: **Partially implemented.** KML and NetCDF loaders work, but RSD loader is a **stub** (only basic metadata, no real parsing).

### 8. GUI (`src/cesarops/gui/`)
- **app.py**: **Partially implemented.** Some methods use `pass` (incomplete). GUI launches, but some features may be missing or stubbed.

### 9. CLI (`src/cesarops/cli.py`)
- **Fully implemented.** Exposes all major features: simulation, GUI, data update, ML training, analysis, literature search, drifter collection, and cloud sync.

## Reference Files
- **reference/sarops.py**: Legacy or reference implementation (not scanned in detail).
- **reference/generate_comprehensive_kml.py**: KML export reference (not scanned in detail).

## Recommendations
- **Review and complete stubbed/placeholder methods** in `enhanced_drift.py`, `sonar/overlay.py`, `analytics/drift_analyzer.py`, `ml/predictor.py`, `gui/app.py`, and `data/sentinel.py`.
- **Test all CLI commands** to verify end-to-end functionality.
- **Check reference files** for any missing logic that should be ported to main modules.
- **Document any new or changed APIs** as you continue to reassemble the codebase.

## Intended Purpose of Each Major Module
- **core/**: Drift simulation and physics utilities
- **data/**: Environmental and drifter data acquisition
- **database.py**: Local SQLite data storage
- **config.py**: Configuration management
- **analytics/**: Drift analysis, error metrics, and POA
- **ml/**: Machine learning drift correction
- **cloud/**: Oracle Cloud data sync and cache
- **reports/**: Incident reporting and KML export
- **sonar/**: Sonar data overlay (KML, NetCDF, RSD)
- **gui/**: Tkinter-based graphical interface
- **cli.py**: Command-line interface for all features
