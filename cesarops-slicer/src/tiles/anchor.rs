//! Tile anchor coordinate system.
//!
//! Each tile gets an "anchor" — its top-left lat/lon calculated ONCE during slicing.
//! This eliminates drift: the scanner adds local pixel offsets to the anchor
//! instead of re-projecting every frame.
//!
//! The anchor is serialized to a sidecar JSON alongside each tile.
